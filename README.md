[Wireless Electricity Transfer]

In this project, we (team) made a basic prototype to demonstrate the wireless Electricity Transfer in our EDC project. I worked in a team of five, acting as leader scored full marks in it. This included components like bjts, coils, resistors, etc.

[Power Optimization]

The system employs sensors or detectors to detect the presence of people in a room and adjusts the lighting levels accordingly to save energy. The Arduino microcontroller acts as the brain of the system, receiving data from the sensors and controlling the bulbs via the breadboard. The potentiometer is used to set the desired lighting level based on user preferences. The system dynamically adjusts the brightness of the bulbs in real-time, dimming or switching off lights when no one is present and increasing brightness when people are detected. This helps to reduce energy wastage by automatically optimizing lighting levels in a room based on occupancy, resulting in significant energy savings. The use of Arduino and breadboard allows for a cost-effective and scalable solution that can be easily implemented in various indoor environments.
